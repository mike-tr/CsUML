# UnityMyNN
machine learning, project,  gotta do it my self!

I wanna learn how to make my own neural networks and implement backprop, while actually understanding the math behind it, so this is my 
c# implemntation of that.

Gotta do some mini projects in there to test the neural network and it capabilities.

First project:
Predict an Polynomial, ecuacion, of the n's power.
and draw a graph based on that prediction. A.k.a get an X value output the Y value.
while taking the XY point based on points the user created on screen.

Second project ?:
maybe make a self navigating car, that has to get to point B with the least amount of damage and the fastest it can.
